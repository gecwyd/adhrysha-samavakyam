    title: "The Progress",
    text: "It all began with the realization that silicon is the new oil. The development of modern society will boost only by electronic and tech self-reliance. At the infant stage, India was heavily reliant on imports. But today, the nation is steadily emerging as a global semiconductor hub, with the domestic market expected to reach $100–110 billion by 2030.",

    title: "Era of Giants",
    text: "Before acquiring massive fabrication capabilities, India initially specialized in chip design and verification. But then the era of giants and precise manufacturing came. Under the India Semiconductor Mission, the government has recently approved 12 massive semiconductor manufacturing projects, carrying an investment pipeline of nearly Rs 1.64 lakh crore. These include silicon fabrication units, compound semiconductor fabs, and advanced packaging units across multiple states.",

    title: "ISM 2.0",
    text: "Following the initial phase, we are now entering ISM 2.0. The Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) has approved a massive outlay of approximately Rs 1.20 lakh crore to expand the mission. This updated version is more powerful, focusing not just on fabrication but on the entire ecosystem: producing semiconductor equipment, raw materials, and developing full-stack Indian intellectual property. The Union Budget 2026–27 has made a provision of Rs. 1,000 crore specifically for ISM 2.0, emphasizing industry-led research and training.",
